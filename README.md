# LoanForesight


This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various features. It utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm for the classification task.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies and concepts are used in this project:

- Support Vector Machines (SVM): A supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis.
- Machine Learning: The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- Data Preprocessing: The process of transforming raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
- Standardization: The process of scaling numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance.
- Python: The programming language used for implementing the project.

## Installation

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: [Loan_ForeSight]( https://github.com/v-pasha/LoanForesight.git)
2. Navigate to the project directory


## Usage

1. Place your loan dataset in the project's root directory with the name `dataset.csv`.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the data.
3. Run the main script to train the SVM model and make predictions.


4. The predicted loan status will be displayed in the console.

## Dataset

The loan dataset should contain the following features:

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- ...
- Feature n
- Loan Status

Ensure that the dataset is in CSV format and that the target variable (Loan Status) is labeled properly.
